Bart chooses to go to war with Nelson uniting the neighborhood children against him. The episode was written by John Swartzwelder and directed by David Silverman.[1] Contents 1 Plot 2 Production 3 Cultural references 4 Reception 4.1 Use in scientific research 5 Home release 6 References 7 External links Plot[edit] Bart gets into a fight with Nelson Muntz, the school bully, while defending Lisa and the cupcakes that she baked for Miss Hoover. Nelson beats up Bart after school and warns him to expect the same treatment the following day. At home, Marge encourages Bart to reason with Nelson. Homer urges him to bend the rules and fight dirty. Taking Homer's advice, Bart is beaten up again. Bart turns to the toughest member of the Simpson family, Grampa Simpson. Grampa introduces Bart to Herman, the crazed one-armed proprietor of an army surplus store. Herman instructs Bart on how to wage war on Nelson. Bart enlists Nelson's other victims in his army and trains them for combat. Herman commands from Bart's treehouse as Bart leads his forces into battle. Ambushing Nelson and his sidekicks, they commence saturation bombing with water balloons. Nelson's thugs surrender, and Nelson is taken prisoner. He threatens to beat up Bart as soon as he is untied. Herman drafts the armistice treaty, which states that Nelson will retain his position and name but will not hold any actual power. Bart and Nelson then both sign, Marge enters with cupcakes, and peace prevails. Production[edit] This episode was running too long to use the normal opening sequence. It therefore did not feature a chalkboard gag or a couch gag. Instead, it just cut to an image of the Simpson house.[2] David Silverman was the director and was kind of stressed, because he was doing storyboards for this episode while also directing "Bart the Genius".[2] Originally, he had planned to use the song "War" by Edwin Starr in the episode. The plans were dropped, when they decided that the song did not really fit the story.[2] The episode had problems with the censors, who did not want the characters to say "family jewels" on prime time television.[3] The producers ignored the notes and "family jewels" remained in the episode. This act of attempted censorship was reflected in the part where Grampa Simpson writes a letter complaining of how sexualized television has become and gives a list of words he never wants to hear on TV again, one of which is "family jewels". Two new characters were introduced in this episode. The first, Nelson Muntz, remains a frequently used recurring character,[4] while the second, Herman, has been used far less.[4] The design of Herman, with the exception of his missing arm, was inspired by writer John Swartzwelder. His voice, as performed by Harry Shearer, was partly inspired by George H. W. Bush.[3] The original idea for Herman was for him to have a differing story for the loss of his arm with every appearance.[3] Cultural references[edit] The episode featured several references to war films. Several lines of dialogue, Bart slapping one of his soldiers for "being a disgrace", and the music was lifted directly from the film Patton from 1970 composed by Jerry Goldsmith. Fox owned the rights to this film, so it was no problem to use the soundtrack.[3] The marching sequence is a nod to Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket from 1987.[4] The Longest Day from 1962 is also referenced.[2] The silhouettes of the children climbing the jungle gym against the setting sun is a reference to Oliver Stone's 1989 film Born on the Fourth of July. Bart concludes the episode by stating that the only "good wars" are the American Revolution, World War II, and the Star Wars trilogy.[5] Reception[edit] In its original American broadcast, "Bart the General" finished 31st place in the weekly ratings for the week of January 29 - February 4, 1990 with a Nielsen rating of 14.3. It was the highest rated show on the Fox Network that week.[6] Since airing, the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics. The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said: "Some good lines and setpieces aside - we love Bart's fantasy of death at Nelson's hands - this episode nevertheless feels a bit unsure of itself, particularly towards the end."[4] In a DVD review of the first season David B. Grelck gave the episode a rating of 3/5 and adds "Another episode that helped to propel Bart's popularity into the stratosphere ...".[7] Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review that the episode "remains a primitive example of The Simpsons, but it?s a reasonably amusing and entertaining experience." and added that the episode "lacks the subtlety and cleverness found on later episodes, but it was onto something."[8] Matt Groening notes on the commentary track that he finds it strange how controversial this episode seemed at the time of its release. Today, they would go a lot further and to him this episode now seems harmless.[3] The episode's reference to Full Metal Jacket was named the eleventh greatest film reference in the history of the show by Nathan Ditum of Total Film.[9] Use in scientific research[edit] "Bart the General" and Seinfeld's "The Tape" were used in a Dartmouth College experiment to study brain activity in relation to humorous moments in television shows. The results were published in a 2004 issue of the academic journal Neurolmage. The researchers noted, "During moments of humor detection, significant [brain] activation was noted in the left posterior middle temporal gyrus ... and left inferior frontal gyrus".[10] Home release[edit] The episode was released first on home video in the United Kingdom, as part of a VHS release titled The Simpsons Collection; the episode was paired with season one episode "There's No Disgrace Like Home".[11] It was released in the US on the VHS release The Best of The Simpsons, Vol. 2 (1997), paired with "Moaning Lisa".[12] It was later re-released in the US in a collector's edition boxed set of the first three volumes of The Best of The Simpsons collections.[13] It was re-released in the UK as part of VHS boxed set of the complete first season, released in November 1999.[14] The episode's debut on the DVD format was as a part of The Simpsons season one DVD set, which was released on September 25, 2001. Groening, Brooks, and Silverman participated in the DVD's audio commentary.[15] A digital edition of the series' first season was published December 20, 2010 in the United States containing the episode, through Amazon Instant Video and iTunes.[16] References[edit] ^ a b Richmond, Ray; Antonia Coffman (1997).
